                <b>Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel</b>, the first Deputy Prime Minister of India, is widely regarded as the "Iron Man of India". He played a crucial role in the Indian independence movement and is credited with uniting India after independence.</br></br>

                Patel was born on October 31, 1875, in Nadiad, Gujarat, India. He was a prominent lawyer and a member of the Indian National Congress, who played a key role in the Quit India Movement in 1942.</br></br>
                
                After India gained independence in 1947, Patel played a crucial role in integrating the princely states into the Indian Union. He worked tirelessly to bring together more than 550 princely states, some of which were reluctant to join India, and succeeded in creating a unified India.</br></br>
                
                Patel was also instrumental in establishing the All India Services, including the Indian Administrative Service and the Indian Police Service, which have played a vital role in India's governance and administration.</br></br>
                
                Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel's legacy as the "Iron Man of India" continues to inspire generations of Indians to work towards the unity and progress of the country.    </br></br>
